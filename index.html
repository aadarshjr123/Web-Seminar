        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            As a student of masters it's important to understand how to structure a master thesis. Because findings done
            after the research should be written in a way that readers can understand easily without misleading or
            missing any important part of the paper. So to write a good scientific paper we have taken 2 models
            primarily , such as CARs model and IMRAD model.

        </p>
        <p>
            "Basically the CaRS Model can help you build an introduction. The model consists of three rhetorical moves
            that help identify the background, motivation, and focus of the research as presented in <a
                href="#r13">[1]</a> ". "Similarly
            “IMRaD” format refers to a paper that is structured by four main sections: Introduction, Methods, Results,
            and Discussion. This format is often used for lab reports as well as for reporting any planned, systematic
            research in the social sciences, natural sciences, or engineering and computer sciences in <a
                href="#r13">[2]</a>"

        </p>
        <p>
            In this paper we explain each and every structure about writing a scientific paper. As it's very difficult
            to take a scientific thesis paper which consists of both models, we have taken two separate scientific
            papers to demonstrate the two models. As a result we have implemented the CaRS model as well as we have
            prepared a thesis structured checklist using IMRaD model.
        </p>

        <h2> 2. CARs model and IMRaD Model</h2>
        <h3> 2.1. CARS Model : Create a Research Space </h3>

        <p>
            The introduction is the most important part of any scientific topic or paper because it helps the readers to
            understand the particular paper without reading the whole context.
            So basically by following the CARS model we can write a good introduction that describes the papers well.
        </p>

            <img src="Image1.png" alt="Overview of CARs Model" />

        </figure>
        <p>
            As shown in Figure 1, The model follows like " “Establishing
            the territory” the author tries to give a basic introduction about the topic. In the second one,
            “Establishing the niche” the
            author finds a gap in a certain
            topic which he or she takes as an initial motivation and tries to resolve through the research.
            The last one, “Occupying the niche”, is an important part of the CARS model, where the author tries to
            submit all the findings that he or she
            has done <a href="#r13">[3]</a>."
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>2.2. Move 1 : Establishing the territory</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="Image2.png" alt="Establishing the territory" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Figure 2</strong>: Establishing the territory <a href="#r13">[3]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            "In this move, the author sets the context for his or her research, providing the necessary background on
            the
            topic <a href="#r13">[3]</a>." There are three steps to satisfy the move.
        </p>
        <h4>2.2.1 Step 1 : Claiming centrality</h4>
        <p>
            As readers are also the writers they will be able to understand the domain which they are looking for by
            mentioni
            ng the centrality of the niche, so it's easy for them to categorise their research in a certain way. So
            as a writer it's important to mention under what domain the paper will fit in.



        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br>
            <br>

            " Recently there has been a spate of interest in ... <a href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>
        <h4>2.2.2 Step 2 : Making topic generalisation</h4>
        <p>
            During the research process or in some time due to the problems they found in certain areas, writers write
            papers by highlighting
            that particular problem which will normally convert into the topic.



        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br>
            <br>

            " Properties of X are still not completely understood <a href="#r13">[3]</a> " .
        </p>
        <h4>2.2.3 Step 3 : Reviewing Previous Items of Research</h4>
        <p>
            As this is a common step in almost every scientific paper, to find out to what extent that domain has been
            explored, we need previous research papers.
            By mentioning them the readers can widen their knowledge on the particular problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br>
            <br>

            " Both Johnson and Morgan claim that the biographical facts have been misrepresented <a href="#r13">[3]</a>
            " .
        </p>

    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>2.3. Move 2 : Establishing the Niche</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="Image3.png" alt="Establishing the Niche" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Figure 3</strong>: Establishing the Niche <a href="#r13">[3]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            "In this move, the author argues that there is an open "niche" in the existing research, a space that needs
            to be filled through additional research.
            The author can establish a niche in one of the four ways <a href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>
        <p>
            So a beginner who is writing scientific papers, it's important to clearly describe our target audience and
            how we proceed with our findings.
            In a writer's point of view, giving a strong opinion on a topic is important, which adds value to the paper
            during the publishing.
        </p>
        <h4>2.3.1 Step 1A : Counter-claiming</h4>
        <p>
            As a writer as well as reader it will be helpful for them to make clear understanding of a particular topic
            which they are looking for ,
            so by doing that they can clearly point out the previous research or an followed method is indicating
            something wrong about a certain topic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br>
            <br>

            " While Jones and Riley believe X method to be accurate, a close examination demonstrates their method to be
            flawed <a href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>
        <h4>2.3.2 Step 1B : Indicating a Gap</h4>
        <p>
            So in this particular move, we came to understand that the writer
            describes the gap he or she found during the research, but not mentioning how to tackle the problem, which
            will be followed in the later section.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br>
            <br>

            " While existing studies have clearly established X, they have not addressed Y <a href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>
        <h4>2.3.3 Step 1C : Question-raising</h4>
        <p>
            The main difference between Step 1 and Step 3 is that Step 1 describes the problem which should be
            rectified, but Step 3 explains the unclear situation about a certain niche.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br>
            <br>

            " While Jones and Morgan have established X, these findings raise a number of
            questions, including ... <a href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>
        <h4>2.3.4 Step 1D : Continuing a tradition</h4>
        <p>
            "The paper tries to follow the same pattern as the rest of the paper with an improved result at the end. <a
                href="#r13">[3]</a>".  So most of the papers in a scientific section we are able to see following this tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br>
            <br>

            " Earlier studies seemed to suggest X. To verify this finding, more work is urgently needed <a
                href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>2.4 Move 3 : Occupying the niche</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="Image4.png" alt="Occupying the niche" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Figure 4</strong>: Occupying the niche <a href="#r13">[3]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            The main difference between move 2 and move 3 is that the author shows some proof which he or she found after the research as an end result. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a crucial part of structuring a paper's introduction, because in move 2, we are providing our
            concrete view to write a paper. But through move 3 we confirm the readers that our claims are true, by
            giving the proof through our research.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are four ways to Occupy a niche according to CARS model,
        </p>
        <h4>2.4.1 Step lA : Outlining Purposes</h4>
        <p>
            " In this section the author provides the theme of the paper which he or she found, but not exactly the
            result
            of the paper <a href="#r13">[3]</a>".
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br>
            <br>

            " In this article I argue ... <a href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>
        <h4>2.4.2 Step lB : Announcing present research</h4>
        <p>
            "The author describes the research in the current article <a href="#r13">[3]</a>"
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br>
            <br>

            " This paper describes three separate studies conducted between March 2008 and January 2009. <a
                href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>
        <h4>2.4.3 Step 2 : Announcing principle findings</h4>
        <p>
            This section will come under the scope in some papers as in this section the author will mention to what
            extent the paper will cover, so the readers will get an early preview of the paper.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br>
            <br>

            " The results of the study suggest ... <a href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>
        <h4>2.4.4 Step 3 : Indicating RA structure</h4>
        <p>
            " This section will come under the scope in some papers as in this section the author will mention to what
            extent the paper will cover <a href="#r13">[4]</a> ", so the readers will get an early preview of the paper.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br>
            <br>

            " This paper is structured as follows ... <a href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>

    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>3. Motivation</h3>

        <p>
            Motivation is a crucial part of writing any paper because most of the motivation comes from problems faced
            by the individual previously in a certain area in which the person is trained. So we have taken an example
            to point out how to create motivation.

        </p>
        <p>
            In below figure 3, the author describes his expertise in the field and the experience he had in that topic.

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            In figure 3.1, After that, the author explains the problems he addressed as issues during that period. And
            we should also try to write in simple terms rather than using complex languages to make it easy for the
            readers.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Scope of an introduction:</h3>

        <p>
            "Scope delineates what will and will not be covered in your project. It helps you focus your work and your
            time, ensuring that you’ll be able to achieve your goals and outcomes <a href="#r13">[6]</a>".

        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>5. Result and conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            As an result we were able to establish two key findings,
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>We have took an example paper to implement CARs model
            </li>
            <li>We have made a checklist for the IMRaD model.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>CARs Model</h4>
        <p>
            In the following section, we will define each move elaborately with examples. Before that to give a brief
            about the paper we have taken to explain this model say that,
        </p>
        <p>
            An API is a connecting element between the frontend and backend. Most of the time
            developers find it hard to use the API because of the poor documentation. " So basically the example paper
            says about how to help frontend as well as end users with the usage of the API <a href="#r13">[6]</a> ".
        </p>

        <h4>1. Move 1 : Establishing the territory</h4>
        <figure>
            <img src="Image5.png" alt="Liste aller Benutzer" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Figure 1</strong>: Overview of CARs Model <a href="#r13">[1]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            There are three steps to satisfy the move.
        </p>
        <h4>1.1. Step 1 : Claiming centrality</h4>
        <p>
            In below diagram we explain detail about the step 1,
        </p>
        <p>
            Diagram 2.1, explains the claiming centrality, where the author of the paper tries to speak about the main
            domain as in that paper the main domain is the Agile development process as it is a widely known territory.
        </p>

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h4>1.2. Step 2 : Making topic generalisation</h4>
        <p>
            In diagram 2.2 below, The author tries to explain the problems in this domain. " As in the previous diagram he
            tries to describe that even though
            the agile methodology can adapt to the latest technology,
            there is not enough progress in the development part of the API for the end user as well as the developer
            community <a href="#r13">[6]</a>. "
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="Image9.png" alt="Liste aller Benutzer" />

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h4>1.3. Step 3 : Reviewing Previous Items of Research</h4>
        <p>
            In this section author has indicated, what are the previous development conducted in this domain.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Move 2 : Establishing the Niche</h4>
        
        <p>
            So in this Move according to the model any one of the steps need to be followed, so according to the papers
            which we took, we were able to prove “Indicating a Gap”. This is an important step as in our research we came to find that most of the papers have been following this step.
        </p>

        <h4>2.1. Step 1B : Indicating a Gap</h4>
        <p>
            As the topic 2.3.2 example says, " author has defined clearly that there is not definition or requiremnt given for API in the agile methodology <a href="#r13">[1]</a>."
        </p>

            In below diagram we explain detail about the step 1,

            In figure 2.4, the author explains the way he implemented the solution in the paper, where he clearly
            explains the thing which he did, so the reader can understand what the paper talks about.

        <h4>3.2 Step 2 : Announcing principle findings</h4>
        <p>
            As in Figure 2.5, we can clearly see that the author explains the result of the paper, but it doesn't start
            with the sentence as shown in the example of the john swales paper. But as the writer of the paper, we can
            create our own introduction by following the rules of this paper.

        <h4>3.3. Step 3 : Indicating RA structure</h4>
        <p>
            In most of the papers we have taken for this study, we have seen this step as a common way to understand the reader what follows the paper.
